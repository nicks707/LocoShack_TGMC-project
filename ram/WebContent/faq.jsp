<center><h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4></center>
<b>What is LocoShack ?</b><br/>
LocoShack is a fun social application, which helps you in discovering interesting places nearby in a personalized way. It gives you recommendations about the best places to eat, shop and hang out; based on the likes and recommendations of people in your social circle.<br/><br/>

<b>Aahh, I got it ! ... you are like Foursquare rite ?</b><br/>
Wait ... not so fast !, We are completely different from Foursquare (and their Indian clones). First of all we have an internal ranking system, which ranks all the places in a neighborhood, based on their online reputation and other social factors. So when you ask LocoShack to show you places nearby, it shows you popular places nearby based on your choice, and not simply a list of all the places where you can check-in from 100 meters away.<br/><br/>

<b>Humm, but how is it useful for me ?</b><br/>
Ok, whenever we go out to eat/shop or just hang out, we decide on places we visit, either by asking a friend or searching the internet. Internet searches mostly end up to local review sites, where you find lot's of reviews, almost all of them being from people we wouldn't know personally or that the reviews are actually fake. They also have star based rating systems ... but all of them are practically useless. 

At LocoShack, we have created one click review mechanism, which is easier and more powerful than star based rating stystems. LocoShack helps you by providing personalized recommendations for the best places, in your locality.<br/><br/>

<b>Personalized Recommendations !!! ... buzzwords huh ! ... Can you explain a bit more ?</b><br/>
Yes, they are actually buzzwords but we take them very seriously :). Personalization simply means that whenever we find that there is a review or a tip from your friend, we show them to you on the top of all other reviews at that place, because that would matter to you more than all other reviews. We are also working on some kick ass features to make your life easier. Follow our blog for the latest updates.<br/><br/>

<b>Sounds Cool, but what if I want to tell my friends how I feel about a place ? I am not a critic kind.</b><br/>
We have made reviewing places a single click task; it's damn easy and fun. Just give it a try by using the 'Share Opinion' button. There is an optional 140 character review, which is basically if you want to write a tip about that place.<br/><br/>

<b>Awesome! but all this will be more helpful if it's available on mobile.</b><br/>
We are already there on mobile. Go to www.LocoShack.com on your mobile browser, it works on majority of touch based devices.<br/><br/>

<b>What about you guyz ... will you give some intro ?</b><br/>
Sure ... we are a bunch of pirates, who love making things from scratch. Still interested ? ... Read more in team section at about us.<br/><br/>

<b>Fine, I want to give it a try, tell me where to start.</b><br/>
Ok, go to our homepage and try our recommendation engine. It is currently live only for a bunch of major cities, but give it a try and we promise that you will love it :). You can also view best places in a city by selecting a city from the drop-down in the top bar.<br/><br/>
