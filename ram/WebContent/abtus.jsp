<b><h4>LocoShack is a visual recommendation engine, which helps you in discovering the best places to eat, shop and hang out. It gives you suggestions about the best places to go, based on your likes and recommendations from people in your social circle. 

We all go out to restaurants, movies, pubs and different places every day. Some of these places we like, some we hate. Most of these places have already been visited by our friends, but sadly there is no way to know their experiences. With LocoShack you and your friends can instantly gain from each others experiences. Avoiding that bad restaurant which spoiled your date is now easy! 

So the next time whenever you are clueless about where to go out to eat, shop or hang out, come to LocoShack and we will show you the best places in your neighborhood. Also when you visit a place, don't forget to share your emotions with your friends on LocoShack.
